# ControlStackAI OS Roadmap

## High-Level Goals
- **Identity**: Professional, consistent ControlStackAI branding (colors, assets, boot).
- **Workflow**: AI-first development environment (Warp, local LLMs, agentic workflows).
- **Stability**: Declarative, reproducible NixOS configuration.

## Phase 1: Branding & Rename (Current)
- [x] Rename host `nymeria` -> `controlstackos`
- [x] Theme Hyprland with ControlStackAI colors (#0C0F14, #B4DCFF)
- [x] Create branded wallpaper and lockscreen assets
- [x] Configure `hyprlock` for a professional lock screen

## Phase 2: AI Dev Environment
- [ ] Standardize AI CLI tools (wrapper around LLMs)
- [ ] Integrate "Dev Workbench" tools
- [ ] MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration

## Future Ideas
- [ ] Custom Plymouth boot splash
- [ ] SDDM theme to match lockscreen
- [ ] Secure boot & disk encryption (Disko)
